    "text": "Hi! I’m Eric, a student in the MDS program at UBC V. 👋\nI’ve always been passionate about engineering, technology, and problem solving as a kid. I feel like that passion has stuck with me this whole time and has given me the chance to be where I am now, trying to make that next jump to advancing my knowledge. My undergrad was in Automation Engineering Technology as I had a big interest in automation, robotics, and being a bit hands on with things🤖.\nTowards the end of my undergrad, I was exposed to AI and data science through my capstone project. My group and I were lucky enough to experiment and test whether we coould create models to predict live EEG signals for directional thoughts🤯. It was definately an ambitious challenge as none of us had the background for it, but the exposure in that project grabbed my attention and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it (Peer Reviewed Journal of My Capstone).\nI hope that down the line in my career, I’m able to combine all my passions for automation, robotics and AI to hopefully work on the line of smart robots, whether that’s through computer vision, path finder algorithms or much more complex ideas that haven’t been experimented on, I hope to be able to contribute to it👨‍💻.\nI enjoy playing golf in my spare time🏌, still terrible at it but that’s part of the joy (I’ve broken 100 twice!). I also used to play and collect pokemon cards, my favourite pokemon are Snorlax, Pikachu, Mew and Mewtwo! I don’t try to hide my playful nature but rather try to harness it as I find it help drive my curiousity and allows me to try things without considering the fear of failure.\nHope you’ve enjoyed getting to know me a little! 😜"
